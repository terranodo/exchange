<h1>Wait For It...</h1>
<p>
This is a "Bad Gateway" response delivered by nginx (HTTP status 502). If you
are seeing this, it means that nginx is configured to proxy to an upstream
server, but it finds that server to be down right now.
</p>
<p>
This kind of error is normal to see if you browse quickly to an instance of
Exchange set up by the development environment before it has had a minute to
boot. Under normal circumstances, it can take 40 seconds or more for Exchange
to finish performing startup tasks like database migrations so that it can
start serving pages from a clean state.
</p>
<p>
Under such normal circumstances, all you have to do is wait; this page will
attempt to refresh itself until the upstream comes up. Hopefully.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible that you are seeing this page at another time, e.g.:
<ul>
    <li>When the app is booting more slowly than it should</li>
    <li>The app isn't booting at all</li>
    <li>The app has gone down and nginx has timed out</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you suspect problems and would like to investigate them, a good place to
start is to inspect the relevant logs, e.g. with these commands executed from
the root of your Exchange checkout:
</p>
<p>
<code>docker-compose logs -f proxy</code><br>
<code>docker-compose logs -f exchange</code><br>
<code>docker-compose logs -f geoserver</code><br>
</p>
</body>
