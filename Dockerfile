# This Dockerfile defines how to build container images containing a
# *development* version of Exchange. It really isn't usable for production, and
# it isn't meant to be; it's for the benefit of people hacking on Exchange.

# The django app is tested on CentOS 6.7 to match client production environment
FROM centos:6.7

# Set up to use the internal yum repo.
# It's normally better practice to use e.g. curl or wget instead of ADD
# to avoid doing the download at every build.
# But in this case, we do want every build to check for changes in
# geoshape.repo, because if it changed then it's possible that the effect of
# the yum installs will change, so that we can't safely reuse the yum installs.
# If geoshape.repo didn't change, the yum installs won't be repeated.
ADD https://yum.boundlessps.com/geoshape.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/

# Prevent yum from invalidating cache every build (default is keepcache=0).
# Pull in initial updates, e.g. security updates
# Install the packages we want for the application
# ... and do one big step to avoid creating extra layers uselessly
# TODO: audit what is needed here or not
